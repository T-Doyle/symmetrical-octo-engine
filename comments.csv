Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2016-07-08T09:15:25,ABHI03,"Dear Friends,
We have one case where for Mill motors in Sugar industry, the bearings are repeatedly failing due to bearing current (Fluting Marks). The NDE side bearing is a insulated bearing though. After last failure incident we have changed the bearings (DE non insulated and NDE insulated). We have also installed Carbon/Grounding brush on DE shaft end out side the end cover. Also the earthing is checked. However again in this season only after operating for 4 months bearings have failed. 
Can you guide me for identifying reason behind and with corrective actions.
Thanks and regards

Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2016-08-29T22:29:47,"""CHUCK BLACKETT""","When ever I have experienced bearings failing from current, the first thing I do is upgrade to ceramic rolling elements in the bearing if possible. It is a no hassle sure fix in most applications, and usually for a cost not that significantly higher than complete steel bearings. Bonus, the hybrid steel and ceramic bearing will also have a longer running life. I have never had luck with shaft grounding brushes. Do you have photos of the bearing races, are you sure it is current damage?"

Sorry for the delay - I was traveling. It is quite clear that the bearing is having an issue with current arcing from that photo. I would go for the grease, or better the ceramic rolling element bearings. The pump OEM that I use to work for switched over to ceramic rolling elements as standard considering the move by the industry to favor VFD solutions. The use of a VFD can increase stray currents and cause problems that otherwise would not have existed. "

Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2016-09-26T18:41:44,SOUNDHOUND,I'd like to add that it's important to make sure when insulating both motor bearings that the driven equipment is insulated from motor. Our company had an instance where preventing another $2K motor rebuild caused a $30K gearbox rebuild because coupling was a metal grid and current went to gearbox bearings.
Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2016-09-30T15:53:09,DAVE REYNOLDS,"I too would like to add some additional experience....Motor 450HP 900RPM 480Volt 3 phase with insulated shafts on both ends, intermittent duty, megged over 1000megs between bare shaft and insulating material on both ends, shaft grounding ring, both bearings have oil not grease and still have electrical fluting. The suspected root cause is the cables from the VFD to the motor not having proper shielding. Had over 300 volts from the rotating shaft to ground!
Best to measure/test to better determine where the fault lies and put a plan in place once the faults have been determined/verified. Could also be inductance from cables lying next to one another in a cable tray, earth ground is weak or broken, rust/dirt between machine and foundation not allowing a good ground to name a few I have ran across in the past

Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2016-09-30T17:17:07,SOUNDHOUND,Good point. We experienced fluting to varying degrees on 9 75hp Extruder motors. Installed a couple of ground rings and then had a rep from ring manufacturer test our motors and he showed we still had problem due to bad ground. Inspection found some ground lugs weren't tight but after fix we still had shaft voltages so all motors got rings. I check voltage levels every 3 months and shafts have to be cleaned regularly due to dirty environment. 1 motor has ring mounted internally but I worry about grease pushing past bearing onto ring.
Bearing current damage on NDE bearing due to bearing current,2019-08-19T18:53:05,SAM THE GROUNDING MAN,"First time on this blog and I see these postings are a few years old, but here goes it anyway:
I reviewed the pictures and agree you are experiencing electrically induced bearing failure.  Incidence rates of bearing failure on VFD motors is at least 60% by 2 years and only continues to climb from there.  It is a well-accepted and pervasive problem that particularly plagues operations that run 24/7.  The following information is based on long-term field and lab studies over 30 years.
1) Capacitive discharge through the bearing is a local event caused by the VFD gated mechanism switching on and off.   VFD brands, altering the carrier frequency, installing induction absorbers on the wiring, shunts, conductive grease, etc. are not a fix for this phenomenon.  A shaft grounding device is the only known way to economically eliminate capacitive discharge through the bearing.
2)  Circulating currents can be present on larger framed motors and are inherent to the motor.  This is different than capacitive coupling as described above under #1.  Our field research has shown that motors 100-200hp and with rpm <=1200 or motors >=200hp regardless of rpm are susceptible to circulating currents.  Incident rates of circulating currents being present is 25-35% for the motor parameters described above.  Insulated bearings will not take care of circulating currents as the current will find a parallel pathway and take out bearings in connected equipment.  A typical set-up to deal with circulating currents is to either provide shaft grounding on both ends of the motor or use an insulated bearing on the non-drive end and a drive end shaft grounding system to break the current loop.
3)  Not all shaft grounding devices are equal.  It is certainly confusing with the different available products on the market.   The following are key principals that cannot be ignored while researching shaft grounding products.  Always have these concepts and questions at the forefront of your mind when researching shaft grounding options:
The grounding system MUST be a better competitor to the bearing for grounding the voltage/current away from the bearing.  While most shaft grounding systems lower shaft voltages right out of the box, not all shaft grounding systems lower voltages below the threshold to prevent current flow through the dielectric (bearing grease) then onto the bearing.  Moreover, most shaft grounding systems cannot maintain for the long-term voltages below the known threshold.  One major manufacturer of shaft grounding rings (SGRs) was asked the question during a webinar ""how do you know the grounding system is working?"" and their response was if the shaft voltage readings are below 10v, then the grounding system is working.  Problem with that response is shaft voltages needs to be much lower than 10v to prevent breakover through the bearing grease.  While 10v will certainly slow down electrically induced bearing damage, it will not eliminate the problem.  We've extensively lab tested the above referenced shaft grounding products and found that out of the box, the shaft grounding ring drops shaft voltages from ~30v peak-to-peak (no shaft grounding) down to 5-7v peak-to-peak.  Even the 5-7v peak-to-peak isn't low enough to prevent dielectric breakover.  As our test motors ran 24/7, the 5-7v creeped up to ~15-17v after just over a year of continuous operation.  These results are better than no shaft grounding, however, the test motors' bearings fluted after 3 years of operation; far less than the motors service life.  
In short, don't be afraid to asked the following questions.  They will cut to the core of how a shaft grounding system performs: 1) what shaft voltages does the shaft grounding system achieve?  2) how does the system maintain the shaft voltages below that threshold known to cause breakover through the bearing grease? 3)  If the environment is dirty, then how does the shaft grounding system ensure a path of least resistance for current to flow away from the bearing?  It doesn't take a lot of contamination to negatively impact shaft grounding performance.  
I hope this information is helpful.  Feel free to let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

I request your advices in order to perform a root cause analysis on a wheel loader (a mining equipment).
The goal is to see why the equipment is not reliable, so I intend to use the ishikawa or fishbone method to see the causes on failure and act on them.
I would like to know if the standard factors decomposition as follow: Measurement, Materials, Personnel, Environment, Methods, Machines is suitable to explain why my equipment is not reliable?
 Or do you think that I should extract all the different problems of the machine  recorded in  a database, focus on one main single problem and perform my ishikwa diagram on that particular problem ?

Complet root cause analysis on a wheel loader,2019-03-08T02:23:02,YOUSUF MASOOD,"RCA is used for single and usually repetitive problem but if your goal is to improve overall reliability then I suggest looking into equipment failure history and take following steps
Calculate MTBF( Mean Time Before Failures) by diving the span of time ( say 1 year) by number of failures
Using Pareto principle , figure out which failure modes are causing highest down times
Then rank these failure modes as per their criticality ( safety/production loss/etc) and select the ones first which are more critical 
Then develop a counter actions list (design improvement/Maint checks/ personnel training/logistics improvement/etc)
Check that if preventative checklist/task list covers the points located in no 3
Develop a critical spare parts list which should be readily available at store for corrective/breakdown action
After 3-6 months recalculate MTBF and compare it with the MTBF calculated previously (in step one) 
Repeat the cycle till desired reliability is achieved !"

How do I rank them per their (criticality safety/production loss/etc) and what are the different factors of criticality? Then do I perform an FMEA on all those three failures to select the most critical, in order to add an RCA (ISHIKIWA) on that one critical problem to implement actions ?"
Complet root cause analysis on a wheel loader,2019-03-14T02:39:42,YOUSUF MASOOD,"Apologies for the late response.
Criticality factors depends on the type of machines and process. However, it is based on the risk of financial loss, safety consequence, loss of reputation etc. \
As a general rule, Risk= probability of failure X consequence of failure
 In terms of Plant machinery,
During say one year time,        Risk ($/yr) = Failure frequency (per year) X Cost consequence ($)
 Now consider the example below :
Now say you have 5 mechanical failures and financial loss is around 100 $ each failure, so using the formula above the risk is 500 $/ year
You have 1 electrical failure and financial loss is 80$ each failure, so the risk is 80 $/year
You have 3 brake failures and each failure costs you 200 $ each failure, so the total risk is 600$ /year.
Now you can rank the failures by the associated financial risk
Brake failures 600$/year
Mechanical Failures 500$/year
Electrical failures 80$/year
 Notice that number of brake failures (3) is less the number of mechanical failures (5) but due to the highest financial impact, it should be taken care of first.
Now if your improving your preventative maintenance, having some brakes in the store , getting better quality brakes , training your people for replace the brake quicker in case of failure etc etc  you can eliminate nearly half 600/1180 of the financial risk.
After wards, follow the same principle on the rank below i.e., Mechanical failure(s)
 Complete and thorough RCA is difficult and time consuming. I suggest do it on the most critical first and then the next and so on "

catastrophic failure,2019-02-19T15:11:07,BECAR,"You should use some pro tension meter like Trummeter, which has its own calculator for suitable belt tension in N or in Hz. Or measure the force directly at the installation. I think the measured belt force on the Trummeter means just force on one side of the belt so you should multiple it roughly by 2 (or consider angles for more precise value). For the new belt installation, the tension value should also be multiplied by 1,3.
When you get this value, it should be reasonably lower than the radial load bearing values."

4. How about oil vapour system?
5. Have you checked the bearing temp? when is it increased? the same for vibration?
If the fire happen in the moment of GT running, i think that the oil leakage happen from internal (if from external, i believe someone seen and announced).
The bearing look like running under too high temp. The oil under high temperature (over 200oC) will form coke. "

I do not have experience on frame 1 but I think you should check some information and answer for yourself that:
1. The leakage oil just happen at Bearing #3 or at all bearings?
Total 4 bearings, All bearings Checked , only bearing#3 found with Babbitt material lost. other 3 bearings found normal.
2. Have you checked the oil drain piping for any plug/stuck? 
Yes Checked , no obstruction or Plugging observed.
3. there is buffer air supplied to labyrinth seal, isn't it? if any, have you checked the buffer air lines? 
Yes, Seal air has been taken from 10th stage of Axial Compressor, air supply lines have been checked and found normal for required seal air pressure.
4. How about oil vapour system?
Please elaborate further on this??
5. Have you checked the bearing temp? when is it increased? the same for vibration?
Under Review.
If the fire happen in the moment of GT running, i think that the oil leakage happen from internal (if from external, i believe someone seen and announced).
Fire smoke has been observed in exhaust duct of GT, soon after GT enclosure was opened and fire was seen, in 1st thought, LO Pump was shutdown and fire was removed, once LO Pump Started again, the fire happened again then again the L.O Pump was shutdown and fire removed. Fire is for sure due to L.O leakage , but still mystery from where the Oil leaked and how the fire caught? and how the L.O penetrated at LP rotor bucket and formed coking/tar since L.O Pressure is lesser than the Turbine Pressure??
The bearing look like running under too high temp. The oil under high temperature (over 200oC) will form coke. 
The bearing#3 damage looks secondary damage due to fire and dry running of LP rotor (since L.O pump was stopped)
How the fire happened , still dont know??

Mechanical seal failure,2018-11-15T19:07:35,ABDULLA,"We are facing multiple seal failures (NDE side seal) in one of our multistage NGL pump . When opened the seal we found water, some black paste, one of the shaft O ring disintegrated, other O rings elongated  etc after only 6 month in service. The seal is from  Flexibox with API plan 53C . The O ring is Viton and supplied by OEM.  The symptoms begins with loosing the barrier seal which required frequent top up.
We suspect   pump product is entering inside seal due to O ring issue and causing spring hangup . Another doubt is assembly error during seal refurbishment. But as per the maintenance who refurbish the seal ( Replacing all parts except casing with new spares) there is no chance for any fitting error as it is a cartridge type seal and passes  the static test every time.
My question is how can we test the O ring in a practical way whether it is compatible for this service. Please bear in mind DE side also uses same components.
Is there any way the product can come to seal other than through secondery seals as the barrier pressure is always high
Is there any error during seal assembly is possible and if yes please explain
Any other thoughts are welcome

Could be the type of barrier fluid you are using that is causing the oring to fail, could be the fluid you are pumping is attacking the oring, could be too hot for oring abilities.
The above links have some good images and details of what to look for on oring failures. I understand the DE is the same design, but are you POSITIVE they use the same barrier fluid? 
What you describe above sounds like chemical attack to the oring, if their was problems with mechanical assembly or vibration in nature, this would not cause the oring to do what you describe. Black gunk sounds like dissolved oring material, and out of shape oring also sounds like swelling of the oring material, are you SURE you have viton in both ends and that viton is compatible with your barrier fluid/product

Firewater pumps p&id and network over pressure protection,2018-09-24T15:47:02,PAULENGR,"I can't imagine why you'd have overpressure protection on fire pumps. For one thing most of the ones I'm familiar with are centrifugals so that wouldn't apply (overpressure is a positive displacement pump thing) and it may not be an actual electrical device but more likely simply a rupture disc. When it comes to fire pumps the general protection strategy with them is to run to failure unless the failure would cause additional consequences with the assumption that responding to a fire is the greater hazard. For example fire pumps specifically do NOT have overload/overcurrent protection because the goal is to run to failure even if it means burning up the motor. However a short circuit can shut down multiple fire pumps and/or cause other unforseen consequences so short circuit (fuse or magnetic-only circuit breaker) protection is included. Based on the same logic though I have never seen a written standard for fire pumps. I would have to imagine that overpressure protection would be along the same lines...even if we blow the line apart or dump water everywhere and hardly get anything put into action to put out the fire, so overpressure protection wouldn't be included."

PaulEngr, good day!
Actually there are many firewater network damages occurred in the past months due to the high pressure.
The sequence will be like that:
1- due to firewater pressure drop, the main electrical pump will start automatically. And from firewater philosophy, it can be stopped manually only.
2- while the operator investigating the cause of the pump start, this pump will keep the pressure increasing in the firewater network untill the pipe joint fails!
 And thats why i want to add a control valve to eliminate the overpressure events.
 Again please if you have any p&id for any firewater system please pass it to me.
Looking for your ideas please.

 Mohammed"

When you say when in ran no load it was ok, then when you started it the second time was is still at a no load condition? I assume necessary tests include:
Voltage present and balanced on stator
No grounding of the stator or rotor.
Resistance is balanced on the stator/surge test
Resistance is balanced on the rotor/armature
Brushes, brush shunts, spring tension, slip ring circuit, resistor all check good?
Sounds like a single phase condition or no voltage getting to the rotor/armature, what about the fuses, breaker, wires to motor, junction box on side of motor.

Without referring the diagnostic plots i think its very difficult to pin point the root causes of the failure. For fluid film tilting pad bearings, we need to refer more plots and one plot may not give clear conclusion. My opinion, since i am practicing vibration analyst more into this type of bearings. For hydro machines this type bearings are commonly used.

Gas Turbine Tilted Pad Journal Bearing Failure,2018-09-05T10:52:16,RAMONRUIZ,"Dear Pawannlng, the possibles causes are:
1.- misalignment (external misalignment)
2.- bearing housing excentricity (internal misalignment)
3.- low lub oil pressure in bearing or any restriction in lub line.
4.- over radial load.
5.- Preload in bearing (internal or external)
we can rule out the last possibles causes using technologies that Rotating Guy said (Shaft centerline, sequence of orbit and time signal, bode and polar possible, spectrum, etc).

Hey Thanks for reply.
I think your doubt about cocked bearing is absolutely right. Because there was spacer between bearing&housing in axial direction, which was out of position in small portion.(we observed it in disassembly). At that time I thought it occurred due to disassembly.

Dry Gas Seal Failures,2018-06-02T04:37:20,SAAD AHMED,"One of our centrifugal compressor 2 BCL 306/A of make GE houses the 3rd and 4th compression stages and is being used at our Urea Plant for feeding CO2 gas into the Urea Reactor at 160 kg/cm2. Compressor is equipped with John Crane make Dry Gas Seals of type 28AT at its drive and non-drive ends. In the last two and a half months, we have experienced twice the failure of non-drive end dry gas seal of aforesaid compressor; details are narrated below:
 The compressor was overhauled in September 2016 and both drive end and non-drive end seal cartridges were replaced. Since then the compressor had been in service No anomaly had been observed in any of the dry gas seals, i.e., no rise in the seal vent pressures till February 2018.
 In February 2018, during annual turnaround of our Urea plant, only bearings of the compressor were replaced and seal cartridges were not removed.  After turnaround, when machine was taken in service, we started experiencing the rise in the vent pressures of only non-drive end dry gas seal; it went up to 7 kg/cm2 against the normal value of 0.2 kg/cm2.
 Moreover, a sharp rise in the replacement frequency of dry gas seal filters was observed; every time when we have dismantled the filter housing for replacing the filter, we have found the cotton fiber filters (5 micron size) covered with brownish dust. Lab analysis revealed the presence of Iron in the process CO2 Pertinent to mention that as the pressure difference of 0.5 kg/cm2 has been maintained between filtered and non-filtered gas all the time of operation, it is therefore confirmed that Iron is passing through the filters
 On April 04, 2018 availing the opportunity of Urea plant outage, the compressor was off lined and both seals were replaced. Upon dismantling the cartridge of non-drive end seal, all internals were found covered with layer of iron rust. Seat and balanced face was in good condition; only balanced face O-ring and thrust ring were found damaged / dislodged.
 The cartridge of drive end seal was found in clean condition and no Iron dust was found on its internals.
 After the maintenance, vent pressure of drive end dry gas seal dropped to normal values of 0.15 to 0.20 kg/cm2. However, after operation of 5 to 6 weeks, again the vent pressure of only non-drive seal started creeping up and as of to date the vent pressure is reached up to 3 kg/cm2.
 Can anyone shed light on this phenomenon. Questions that come to mind:
Is the fine Iron dust responsible for repeated failure of non-drive end dry gas seal; if so how Iron is impairing the functionality of dry gas seal.
Why Iron dust is only going into the non-drive end dry gas seal and not in the drive end seal. Be noted that d/s of filter the same line splits into two lines leading to each seal ."
Dry Gas Seal Failures,2018-06-06T07:10:05,LÊ VŨ,"Dear SAAD AHMED!
I don't know why iron can enter dry gas seal, because pressure of filtered gas always higher process gas at compressor.
At our plant we have same problem with DGS, however root cause to failure DGS is liquid enter DGS to damage seal face.

 If I correctly understood your posts, the trip took place on electrical protection when the motor current activated the overload trip relay. This is odd if an identical sister machine runs at the same current but it does not trip.

          previous failure was 2 years back and we use SPM instrument for condition monitoring.Does fitment and clearance is the cause for three failures??
Any Problem due to load ???
Im just curious that this is sudden failure or the failure developed? i doubt at the data collection since this is not sees that will generate fault.

There is no chance of vane pass effect since the pump was overhauled recently and no damages where observed."

Many styles of centrifugal pumps, can you add more detail
Most of the time, pumps have 2-3 bearings/shaft/impeller/coupling. So if you truly have a 5x peak synchronous to machine running speed and you have 5 vanes on the impeller, then it is vane pass. Bearings will be non-synchronous data
I also see what appears to be harmonics of vane pass, did you change impeller size recently, is there a check valve or valve in general that is stuck or not working properly?
Just by ""overhauling"" a pump does not mean it can not have vane pass......."
Vibration at 5X NDE AND DE V for Centrifugal Pump,2018-04-19T11:58:31,WSS,"The pump was overhauled as a part of routine maintenance ,there was no indication of vibration prior to overhauling.
LPT was carried out on impeller during overhauling and no damages where observed also when we calibrated the rotor for balancing we found that it was already under tolerance.
This are the main reasons I ruled out vane pass.
This horizontally mounted centrifugal pump acts as a overhung rotor,having a bellow in the suction side and connected to motor using a flexible coupling.Pump has 2 angle contact bearing in DE and one radial bearing in NDE.
I carried out shock pulse test and found bearing pulse to be just under warning range"

spectrum wasn't sufficient enough for analysing, if you could provide enveloping and TWF will help to know what is fault.
 try to run motor alone and gathered the data and check if this frequency arise.

Vibration at 5X NDE AND DE V for Centrifugal Pump,2018-04-21T12:55:19,DAVE REYNOLDS,"The pump was overhauled as a part of routine maintenance ,there was no indication of vibration prior to overhauling. ok, then it should not be vibrating now right....then something changed...is the pump running backwards, just because the valve handle moved does not mean the internals moved, did something fall/collapse and block pump inlet, are flows and pressure normal, did you change impeller size
I assume ""calibrated"" means balanced the impeller
This are the main reasons I ruled out vane pass. I agree that as long as you did not change impeller size or design then there should not be vane pass, but if the suction or discharge of your pump is partially blocked you can see vane pass, it is created by hydraulic issues with pump performance. Like not enough liquid on suction side or restricted piping on discharge due to dirt buildup
This horizontally mounted centrifugal pump acts as a overhung rotor,having a bellow in the suction side and connected to motor using a flexible coupling.Pump has 2 angle contact bearing in DE and one radial bearing in NDE.
I carried out shock pulse test and found bearing pulse to be just under warning range shock pulse does not account for vane pass or 1x or 2x, it uses the ultrasonic range to identify faults at an early stage, very sensitive to flow/cavitation/lubrication defects

Vibration at 5X NDE AND DE V for Centrifugal Pump,2018-04-22T05:16:07,WSS,"Thank you guys for your reply.The pump is at site and we are service contractors.So is it safe to conclude that occurrence of vibration is not due to any wrong procedure in overhauling (ie. balancing,Replaced bearings and gasket,mech seal test)? 
Please note we had changed the bearings too."

 Very Interesting case. only 5X dominating. No problems noticed in spectrum. All unique components are in good condition.  
3.84 mm/s at 5X is still in normal condition. However, the cause of 5X dominant can appear due to flow conditions like impeller stall. 
 Check the pump suction and delivery valves, system flow conditions (full flow or throttled flow) Load on motor etc.,
Pleased to see such isolated case.

Its 4.8mm/s now.We are planing to take it down once it peaks over  5.5mm/s and give a check of the valves and other flow condition.The check valve on discharge line is normally on full open or full closed condition."

WELL NOTED. 
THANKS FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
PLEASE FOLLOW THIS METHOD AND TRY HOW YOUR VIBRATIONS ARE INDICATING.
1. CLOSE DISCHARGE VALVE AND START THE PUMP AFTER FEW SECONDS AT FULL SPEED AT MAXIMUM PRESSURE MEASURE THE VIBRATION SLOWLY OPEN DISCHARGE VALVE AND MEASURE THE VIBRATION. 
IF FLOW INCREASING TIME VIBRATION RISING IT IS RELATED TO FLOW SURGES CAUSING THE VIBRATION. IF STEADY AT EVERY DISCHARGE VALVE POSITION THEN THE VIBRATION IS NOT FLOW RELATED.
ALSO TAKE RUN UP AND COAST DOWN AND RECORD RESONANCE FREQUENCY.
BUMP TEST ALSO HELPS BUT RUN UP/COAST DOWN IS BETTER.
APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK.
 REGARDS

High Vibration on bearing #2 and #3 on gas Turbine frame 9E (100 MW),2018-04-10T11:51:24,NGO DINH,"First, I think you should give us some data (APHT trend, waterfall, SCL, orbit... if any)for review and also the arrangement of machine. I do not know where is bearing#2 or 3 and so on. 
You said that the casing have done bore alignment due to center of bearing housing 2 and 3 is not coincided. How about the alignment result and how about the rotor center position check (done at some hole on casing). how about labyrinth clearance at both side of bearing? how about the phase?"
Carbon ring seal used for integrally geared centrifugal compressor,2018-03-19T16:16:43,LUX,"Dear Friends,
Anyone had the expience of carbon ring seal used for centrifugal compressor and would like to give me some comments on the following issues.
In these years we always experienced many issues of carbon ring seals on our integrally geared centrifugal compressors. The main issues on the carbon ring seals are as follows:
Broken detent pinè then carbon ring was rotated together shaft in the seal housing.
The lip seal of carbon seal is completely worn out and subsequently the carbon ring was stuck at this positionè cannot float so as to result in high vibration.
Stuck carbon ring in the seal housingè then uneven wear on the carbon ring è finally resulted in machine trip caused by high vibration.
Worn detent pin hole on the carbon ringè then carbon ring was unable to freely float in the seal housingè finally resulted in rubbing with shaft and consequent machine high vibration trip.
These pictures of current carbon seals are attached below for your reference. .
I don’t find any information of the damaged carbon seal in the compressor manual, but I saw the following description of carbon seals in the manual of another compressor that the attention must be paid to be direction dependent position of the detent pins and from the picture, it looks like the detent pin position should be set at horizontal direction but not like our current mounting position that the detent pin is put at basically vertical direction with an angle offset of 11.5 degrees towards left or right.
Could you kindly help on the following questions:
The detent pin must be put at horizontal direction ( 3’ clock or 6’ clock)? -----If this is necessary during the mounting, then could you kindly tell me what the real reason is ?
The detent pin must be depended on the shaft rotation direction? ----If this is necessary during the mounting, then could you kindly tell me what the real reason is?
What is a proper length of the detent pin? Because we always find that the pin is broken or worn, we have to machine some pins for the mounting of new carbon ring during the urgent cases. It is better if you can tell me the actual requirement on the length of the detect pin.
We also have carbon ring (from your company) designed on the Siemens compressors, but till now we haven’t experienced any issues on these machines. I believe the current issue should be caused by some reasons besides carbon seal self, such as carbon seal installation….. Could you kindly teach me that details should be well followed during the actual installation, otherwise it will be able to cause those issues mentioned above.
  Your kind help on my questions will be very appreciated. Looking forward to seeing your reply"
